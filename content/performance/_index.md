# Welcome

I've been explaining my art since grad school as illustrating "problems and failures in modern society", which is a line I stole from Michael Hanenke's [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) page in [2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_(disambiguation)).

[Email me](realfakenewyorker@gmail.com) if you agree. If you don't, I invite you to ponder further.
